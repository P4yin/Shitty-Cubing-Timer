# Shitty-Cubing-Timer
Lmao. This MIGHT be accurate.
If your non copyrightable name here time breaks, use this timer.
I used an Atmega328 microcontroller to control this with Arduino Uno bootloaded on.
This was coded in Arduino.
Watch my video to see stuff like components I used.
Do whatever with the code.

How to use:
In any way conveievable, upload your code to your microcontroller. Press the non reset button, and then place your finger against the light sensor (https://solarbotics.com/product/17092/). Then let go and it should start. Then to stop place finger against sensor.
